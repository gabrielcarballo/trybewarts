# Trybewarts School Feedback Form Project

This project is a feedback form for the Trybewarts School of Magic, where students can submit their feedback. The theme of this project is based on J.K. Rowling's 'Harry Potter' series.

## Project Overview

The Trybewarts feedback form allows students to:

- Submit their name, surname, and email.
- Select their house from Gitn√≥ria, Reactpuff, Corvinode, and Pytherina.
- Choose the family they most identify with.
- Select the subjects they are most interested in learning: Hofs, Jest, Promises, React, SQL, Python.
- Rate their satisfaction with Trybewarts from 1 to 10.
- Leave a comment with a maximum of 500 characters.
- Agree to the use of the above information.

The form is replaced by the student's information when the "Submit" button is clicked.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several JavaScript functions:

- `catchfamily()`: This function gathers the student's chosen family.
- `catchConteudo()`: This function gathers the student's chosen subjects.
- `catchRate()`: This function gathers the student's satisfaction rating.
- `submitForm()`: This function gathers the values from the form fields, hides the form, creates a new `div` element, and populates it with the gathered form data.

## Project Requirements

The project meets all the requirements specified in the bootcamp project readme. It has been developed with a screen resolution of 1366 x 768, and all images used are less than 500Kb in size.
